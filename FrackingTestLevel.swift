        Fracking - a process that helps extract oil and natural gas from impermeable rock formations.
            We don’t know the mixture in the liquid used for fracking because it’s withheld as a trade secret, but it is proven that they can cause health issues like cancer.
            Even if it doesn’t leak into anything, fracking is very loud, and requires bright lights, their equipment — like flare stacks — cause smog, and the trucks they use to transport equipment are heavy and damage roads.
            When things do go wrong, the water they fill with chemicals can leak into drinking water, cause earthquakes, leak methane, and even cause explosions.
            Fracking uses federal loopholes which makes it not considered hazardous by the government.
            The law defined by the government leaves most of the responsibility to the states, and that means some states, like New York have banned it, and states who let it loose, like Pennsylvania.
            Local governments, in some states, have the power to ban fracking. In states that don’t, you’re still allowed to regulate where it’s placed in the city, like away from a residential area.
